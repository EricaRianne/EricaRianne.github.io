### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite lab of mine because of the math equation and conversion that we had to use. I was abe to experience how to only use strictly for a whole process of code. Watching the conversion amazed me because it made me realize that there is a major connection between math and coding.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was another favorite of mine because of the idea of creating guessing game that knew it had an answer. It surprised me that I could code something that was able to loop something and be able to be used for a game that is relatively simple. Making an infinite loop was interesting because in the lab, the only way to exit that loop was to leave the game. Meaning it could've gone on forever and ever. It's clear to me, because of this lab, coding can be utilized for many things.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1, was one of the most important labs and it was the very first one that we did on our own. The reason why this is one of my favorites to me is because it was my introduction to computer science. It showed me how to format in the C++ style, it allowed me to understand how to format for the future labs. It showed me that I was able to code and be able to develop a love towards coding. With formatting and linting, it was the two things that showed me that coding can be done and that there is a lot more to discover.
